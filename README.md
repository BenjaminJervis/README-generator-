  ## Description
  We were given starter code including Utils, package-lockjson and package.json. I had to create an array of questions in the index.js file so that the user can answer them. I had to create a template literal in the generate markdown file contained within the utils file. In the JS file I added an arrow function to start the program. I then used the .then function to generate a .md file. I then called the function to run the program. 
  
  ## technology 
  To make the program I used inquirer npm, package JSON, JSON, VS code, Git Hub and Javascript.
